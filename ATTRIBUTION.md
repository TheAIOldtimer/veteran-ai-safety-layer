# Attribution

This safety layer was developed as part of the **Zentrafuge** project —
a veteran mental health AI companion built to provide emotionally intelligent,
trauma-informed support to veterans and their families.

## What Was Built Here

The components in this repository represent real production code developed
through extensive testing with a veteran user base. The safety keyword lists,
risk escalation logic, emotional arc analysis, and persona principles were
refined iteratively based on what actually works — not just what looks good
in theory.

If you extend or improve any of these components, consider opening a pull
request. Veterans using your platform will benefit, and so will veterans
using ours.
